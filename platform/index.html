            <p>
               I had been considering running for Vice-President Academic for
			   many months prior to the election. Through working closely with
			   the current VPA over the summer, I realized that it was
			   something that I wanted to do and was capable of doing. The best
			   part of the VPA portfolio is working towards quality of
			   education, in my opinion, because I think that strides made in
			   that area impact all undergraduates tangibly. Another reason why
			   the VP Academic portfolio draws me above the others is the
			   subtleties and intricacies that are associated with university
			   governance and advocacy. I am very interested and passionate
			   about this area of governance and the VPA gets to be right in
			   the thick of it. I really have a passion for governance, student
			   governance in particular, therefore, this looks to be an excellent job.
            </p>
			<p>
				The intent of this document is to outline my campaign points
				completely, and in detail. It is broken down into eight
				sections: Mandatory Rubrics, Textbook Library, Online Textbook
				Registry, Departmental Association Recognition, International
				Student Advocacy, Supporting Faculty Associations, Petitions,
				and Taking on the Recommendation of SERC.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks for reading, and all the best to you.

            <h2 class="content-subhead" id="mandatory-rubrics">Mandatory Rubrics for Large Assignments</h2>
            <p>
                My first point is related to quality of education. If I am
				elected as Vice-President Academic of the Students’ Union, I
				will advocate for mandatory rubrics to be given by professors
				to students for assignments that are worth more than 20% of the
				course grade. The professor must outline in writing exactly
				what the student will be graded on in the assignment so that
				the student knows what the professor is looking for. Not only
				will this help students to achieve fairer grades, but it will
				benefit the professors or TAs that grade assignments by
				clarifying exactly what they should be looking for in each
				piece.
			</p>
			<p>
				This policy is deceptively simple. We would need to draft the
				policy, then bring it to Academic Standards Committee and GFC
				Executive Committee for review, once it is passed there, UAPPOL
				would be amended to include it. Following that, the information
				would have to be distributed to professors and then
				implemented.
			</p>
			<p>
				The process is simple enough on paper, however, there are a few
				challenges that I perceive. Students can be outvoted on both
				ASC and GFC Exec, so prior to the vote at either of those
				committees, I would meet with the members of those committees
				and speak with them about the merits of the new policy, taking
				their concerns about it into consideration. I also see the
				dissemination of information to all profs as being somewhat of
				a challenge, however, in every class I’ve noticed that the
				syllabus contains the Academic Honesty policy, so I hope to
				find out what method was used to let professors know they had
				to have that in their course syllabus and reproduce it for this
				policy.
            </p>
			
			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="textbook-library">Textbook Library</h2>
			<p>
				Costly textbooks are an ongoing concern for students. My vision
				is to convert the silent room in the Students’ Union Building
				into a textbook library. The textbook library would be a quiet
				room full of comfy chairs, tables, and shelves of textbooks
				from a range of faculties and departments. After swiping a
				Onecard, University of Alberta students would be free to read
				the textbooks available in the room at no cost outside of the
				SU fees that students already pay. I am hoping that the
				textbook library will lift at least some of the burden off of
				students who cannot afford textbooks, and also students who
				would benefit from saving a few hundred dollars per year.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are a number of considerations that I would have to make
				before implementing a textbook library. The first of which is:
				how will the Students’ Union obtain so many textbooks? I was
				thinking that the SU will pay students the same price that they
				would have gotten from the bookstore buy-back, but if students
				are willing to donate their old textbooks, that would be
				greatly appreciated. If there are massive gaps, the SU may
				purchase new textbooks from the bookstore, but the SU just
				doesn’t have the budget to purchase all textbooks new.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another consideration is staffing. My plan for this is too set
				up a mini infolink desk in the textbook library and expand
				infolink. However, I have yet to discuss this with infolink.
				Alternatively, the SU could take volunteers for the position.
			<p>
				A third consideration is that there may be legal costs to the
				implementation of a textbook library. It is much like a library
				reserve in many ways and one of the reasons the reserves in the
				libraries are not as prominent anymore is because of copyright
				issues. The decline of the reserves is more of a precautionary
				action than a reaction, however, and I believe that the SU will
				be able to take the necessary steps to provide this service.
			</p>
			<p>
				A final consideration is whether or not this service would step
				on the toes of Faculty Associations that hold faculty-specific
				textbook exchanges. I don’t believe it will. The textbook
				library is a different type of service since students are not
				able to keep the books that they borrow.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="online-textbook-registry">Online Textbook Registry</h2>
			<p>
				You may or may not know that the Students’ Union already has an
				<a href="https://services.su.ualberta.ca/usedbook/">online
				textbook registry.</a> You’ll notice that, while it is
				functional, it is not very effective or intuitive. It would be
				more effective if more students used it because there would be
				a greater selection of textbooks listed. However, many students
				do not know about it, and it is not very easy to use, nor does
				it give the impression of being a professional service.
			</p>
			<p>
				I would really like the online textbook registry to work well
				for students. While there has been a request in to the online
				servicing company the SU uses for a very long time, no progress
				has been made in improving the site yet. I plan to redirect the
				project to a different party, perhaps as a Community Service
				Learning project, or else, ensure that the textbook registry
				becomes a priority.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to revamping the service already provided, I hope
				to include a message board for students to communicate with
				each other about sharing textbooks. I have never done this, but
				my friends were telling me that sometimes, if they have a
				friend in their class, they will jointly purchase a textbook,
				distributing the cost among two or three people, and share the
				textbook and study together. It is my hope that a message board
				on the site could facilitate such a camaraderie among students
				taking the same classes.
			</p>
			<p>
				One complexity with revamping the online textbook registry is
				duplicating the efforts of the
				<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2255838850/">U of A
				Used Book Facebook Page,</a>  because there is excess of 6000
				members and my understanding is that it is very successful.
				This facebook page does demonstrate to me that there is a
				desire among students for a service that allows them to easily
				sell or exchange their textbooks. If elected, I hope to work in
				tandem with this Facebook page to create some integrative and
				modern.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="departmental-association-recognition">Departmental Association Recognition</h2>
			<p>
				Departmental Associations are incredibly important
				organizations on campus. Sometimes they go by different names
				(Program Associations, Department Clubs, Program Clubs), but
				they all have an essential role in advocacy. Departmental
				Associations are responsible for advocating student interests
				to the departments, as well as filling student seats on
				Department Councils and Department Council Standing Committees.
				Advocating to Department Councils is especially important in
				years with significant budget cuts because those councils are
				the places where big decisions, such as some program cuts and
				department chair hiring, are made. There is a lot going on in
				the upper levels of governance at the University, but often,
				the most noticeable changes are made at the levels closest to
				the students.
			</p>
			<p>
				What I would like to do is codify all the existing
				organizations that meet the criteria for being a representative
				organizations and bring them under the Students’ Union as
				Student Representative Associations, much like what we have
				done with the Residence Associations. What this means for DAs
				is extra support and resources from the Students’ Union as well
				as a specialized student group registration. Whereas DAs
				currently fall under the Dean of Students as regular student
				groups, if the change I am suggesting is implemented, they
				would fall under the Students’ Union.
			</p>
			<p>
				Without getting too technical, section 93 of the Post-Secondary
				Learning Act, the provincial legislation that governs post-
				secondary institutions, is very interesting (subjective), and
				is very important to student associations in Alberta. Not only
				does it state that every institution must have a representative
				student association, at the U of A, that’s the SU, but it also
				states that the student association is responsible for the
				administration of student affairs including the development and
				management of student committees. As it stands, the SU
				delegates representative power to Faculty Associations for the
				administration of student affairs for faculties under this
				legislation. I think this representative power should be
				extended to Departmental Associations.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="subhead-content" id="international-student-advocacy">International Student Advocacy</h2>
			<p>
				This year, the SU executive team have assisted in laying the
				groundwork for the creation of an International Students
				Association. This will be an important mechanism through which
				international students are represented in the university
				governance structure.
			</p>
			<p>
				If elected, I am willing to see through the ISA’s inclusion as
				a student representative association in the SU bylaws, and
				facilitate the creation of such an organization in any way
				possible. We should also bear in mind while doing so that the
				process we use will set a precedent for the future
				implementation of similar organizations for student groups on
				campus with a special status in relation to the university.
				Therefore, we should ensure that the process used is solid and
				reproducible.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="subhead-content" id="support-faculty-associations">Support Faculty Associations</h2>
			<p>
				The title of this section is misleading because the job of any
				and every VPA is to support student representatives to the best
				of their ability, thus, this section is primarily to outline
				exactly how I will go about doing that.
			</p>
			<p>
				For Faculty Associations, I pledge to obtain a designated
				financial reviewer to make the annual financial reviews easier.
				This will not be a staff member of the Students’ Union, but
				rather I will search for a reliable company that is willing to
				give Faculty Associations a good deal on financial reviews if
				we guarantee them business every year. The company will be
				accustomed to doing reviews of this type, Faculty Association
				executives will not have to hunt down a reviewer and will know
				in advance what it will cost exactly.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will also work with Council of Faculty Associations and
				faculties to create a definition for adequate consultation. In
				many instances, a faculty must consult students before making a
				decision, but what does that mean? Is it okay just to talk to
				one student? Do they have to hold a town hall? Student
				interests would be better served if a minimum standard for what
				student consultation is, is outlined.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="subhead-content" id="petitions">Petitions</h2>
			<p>
				This section is about the continuation of a project that the
				current VP Academic began that I believe to be very important
				in terms of communicating better with the student body.
				Students’ Council currently makes use of two of three common
				constituent communication mechanism. Council uses referenda and
				plebiscites, they have sunshine legislation (meaning that any
				student can sit in on any Council meeting), but they do not
				employ citizen’s initiatives, or in other words, petitions.
				Allowing students at large to create petitions connects the
				student body with the SU and allows Council to get more
				feedback from SU membership. It is also great if a student has
				one really good idea they want to see implemented, but don’t
				necessarily want to run for Council.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Students’ Union has been looking into creating an online
				petition system for any undergraduate student to use. The
				project has been conceptualized and is currently in the
				consultation stage. On the front page of the Students’ Union
				website, there will be a link to the petition section of the
				website, after clicking this link the student will have to
				authenticate using their CCID. Once the student logs in they
				will be able to either view petitions made by either students
				or create their own. In order to create a petition, the student
				will need to enter a title and brief description, then make
				sure their petition is not the same as one that has already
				been submitted, then the student may submit it. After
				submitting, the student can share the link to their petition
				via social media or any other digital means. Students that
				click on the link will be asked to authenticate using their
				CCID, and then may sign any petition with an e-signature. Once
				a petition has reached a certain threshold of signatures, the
				department of Discover Governance will be alerted, and the
				petition will automatically be placed on the agenda of the next
				Students’ Council meeting or forwarded to the appropriate
				Faculty Association. Council must discuss the petition, but
				they can decline to do what it says.
			</p>
			<p>
				The process for implementing the petition system is relatively
				simple. First, consultation with Faculty Association Executives
				and councillors must be completed. Student representatives must
				be on board with the plan or else it cannot be implemented. The
				next step is to have the web application developed. When it is
				completed, a year-long trial will begin, and the system will be
				advertised heavily. Discover Governance will monitor the use of
				the petition system and note flaws and successes. After the
				year is done, Council will evaluate the successes and failures
				of the system and vote on whether to keep it or not.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="subhead-content" id="take-on-recommendations-of-serc">Take on the Recommendations of SERC</h2>
			<p>
				The Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee is not
				composed of councillors but does advise the executive in areas
				of social and environmental sustainability. Each semester, I
				will request a list of recommendations from SERC for the SU
				executive and the VP Academic portfolio specifically. I will,
				at the very least, make an attempt to implement SERC’s
				recommendations or get the ball rolling for projects that will
				take more than one year. I will provide SERC with regular
				progress reports regarding their recommendations.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="subhead-content" id="department-opt-out-exam-registry">Department Opt Out of Exam Registry</h2>
			<p>
				The <a href="http://su.ualberta.ca/services/infolink/exam/">
				exam registry</a> is an excellent service already provide by
				the Students’ Union. However, at the discretion of Faculty
				Councils, entire departments can opt out of the policy that
				demands departments to provide evaluative or representative
				evaluative course material to the exam registry. I hope to look
				into the reasons for why departments have the ability to opt
				out of this policy entirely and attempt to repeal or alter the
				policy so that evaluative or representative evaluative course
				materials are available to students taking classes in every
				department.
