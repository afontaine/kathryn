            <p>
               I had been considering running for Vice-President Academic for
			   many months prior to the election. Through working closely with
			   the current VPA over the summer, I realized that it was
			   something that I wanted to do and was capable of doing. The best
			   part of the VPA portfolio is working towards quality of
			   education, in my opinion, because I think that strides made in
			   that area impact all undergraduates tangibly. Another reason why
			   the VP Academic portfolio draws me above the others is the
			   subtleties and intricacies that are associated with university
			   governance and advocacy. I am very interested and passionate
			   about this area of governance and the VPA gets to be right in
			   the thick of it. I really have a passion for governance, student
			   governance in particular, therefore, this looks to be an excellent job.
            </p>

				The intent of this document is to outline my campaign points
				completely, and in detail. It is broken down into eight
				sections: Mandatory Rubrics, Textbook Library, Online Textbook
				Registry, Departmental Association Recognition, International
				Student Advocacy, Supporting Faculty Associations, Petitions,
				and Taking on the Recommendation of SERC.

				Thanks for reading, and all the best to you.

            <h2 class="content-subhead" id="mandatory-rubrics">Mandatory Rubrics for Large Assignments</h2>
            <p>
                My first point is related to quality of education. If I am
				elected as Vice-President Academic of the Students’ Union, I
				will advocate for mandatory rubrics to be given by professors
				to students for assignments that are worth more than 20% of the
				course grade. The professor must outline in writing exactly
				what the student will be graded on in the assignment so that
				the student knows what the professor is looking for. Not only
				will this help students to achieve fairer grades, but it will
				benefit the professors or TAs that grade assignments by
				clarifying exactly what they should be looking for in each
				piece.
			</p>
			<p>
				This policy is deceptively simple. We would need to draft the
				policy, then bring it to Academic Standards Committee and GFC
				Executive Committee for review, once it is passed there, UAPPOL
				would be amended to include it. Following that, the information
				would have to be distributed to professors and then
				implemented.
			</p>
			<p>
				The process is simple enough on paper, however, there are a few
				challenges that I perceive. Students can be outvoted on both
				ASC and GFC Exec, so prior to the vote at either of those
				committees, I would meet with the members of those committees
				and speak with them about the merits of the new policy, taking
				their concerns about it into consideration. I also see the
				dissemination of information to all profs as being somewhat of
				a challenge, however, in every class I’ve noticed that the
				syllabus contains the Academic Honesty policy, so I hope to
				find out what method was used to let professors know they had
				to have that in their course syllabus and reproduce it for this
				policy.
            </p>
			
			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="textbook-library">Textbook Library</h2>
			<p>
				Costly textbooks are an ongoing concern for students. My vision
				is to convert the silent room in the Students’ Union Building
				into a textbook library. The textbook library would be a quiet
				room full of comfy chairs, tables, and shelves of textbooks
				from a range of faculties and departments. After swiping a
				Onecard, University of Alberta students would be free to read
				the textbooks available in the room at no cost outside of the
				SU fees that students already pay. I am hoping that the
				textbook library will lift at least some of the burden off of
				students who cannot afford textbooks, and also students who
				would benefit from saving a few hundred dollars per year.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are a number of considerations that I would have to make
				before implementing a textbook library. The first of which is:
				how will the Students’ Union obtain so many textbooks? I was
				thinking that the SU will pay students the same price that they
				would have gotten from the bookstore buy-back, but if students
				are willing to donate their old textbooks, that would be
				greatly appreciated. If there are massive gaps, the SU may
				purchase new textbooks from the bookstore, but the SU just
				doesn’t have the budget to purchase all textbooks new.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another consideration is staffing. My plan for this is too set
				up a mini infolink desk in the textbook library and expand
				infolink. However, I have yet to discuss this with infolink.
				Alternatively, the SU could take volunteers for the position.
			<p>
				A third consideration is that there may be legal costs to the
				implementation of a textbook library. It is much like a library
				reserve in many ways and one of the reasons the reserves in the
				libraries are not as prominent anymore is because of copyright
				issues. The decline of the reserves is more of a precautionary
				action than a reaction, however, and I believe that the SU will
				be able to take the necessary steps to provide this service.
			</p>
			<p>
				A final consideration is whether or not this service would step
				on the toes of Faculty Associations that hold faculty-specific
				textbook exchanges. I don’t believe it will. The textbook
				library is a different type of service since students are not
				able to keep the books that they borrow.
